‚ö†Ô∏è HTML in markdown is quite unsafe, but if you want to support it, you can
use [`rehype-raw`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-raw).
You should probably combine it with
[`rehype-sanitize`](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype-sanitize).

const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const pathContents = '/contents';
app.use(cors());
app.use(pathContents, express.static('contents'));

app.use('/titles', async (req, res) => {
  const fileList = await fs.readdir(path.join(__dirname, pathContents));
  res.json(fileList);
});
app.use('/', (_, response) => response.send('<h1>get out!</h1>'));

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000, () => {
  console.log('server started');
