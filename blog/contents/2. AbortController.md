`AbortController` became in Node.js starting from version 15.4.0.
Before this, developers had to come up with different constructs and adapters to handle asynchronous operations and cancel them when needed. Now, using `AbortController` and its associated APIs makes this process much easier and more convenient.

Where can `AbortController` be useful? Essentially, anywhere there is asynchronicity, especially with long-running operations like database queries or requests to external services.

Here's a demonstration example:

```js
const controller = new AbortController();
const timeoutSignal = AbortSignal.timeout(3000);

const fetchTodo = async () => {
  const combinedSignal = AbortSignal.any([timeoutSignal, controller.signal]);
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url, { signal: combinedSignal });
    // Handle the response
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.name === 'AbortError' || error.name === 'TimeoutError') {
      console.log('Operation aborted');
    }
  }
};

setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 5000);

fetchTodo();
```

In this example, you can see how `AbortController` allows us to combine signals. We can use multiple signals, like a timeout and manual abort, and pass them into the request. If any of these signals are triggered, the operation will be aborted.
